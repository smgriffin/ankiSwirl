# ankiSwirl
Anki deck to help those new to R programming.  It follows the swirl package, which you can learn more about here: https://swirlstats.com or by typing install.packages("swirl") then library(swirl) and swirl() in your R console or RStudio.


To Install:
1. You will need to download the anki app here https://apps.ankiweb.net
2. Open anki
3. Select Import File

To Study by Specific Topic:

The cards are organized by tags so to study a specific topic you can either suspend the cards without the tag in the Browse section, or create a custom study and then select Study by Tag.

I will continue to add more cards as I work through the tutorial and refresh my memory.
